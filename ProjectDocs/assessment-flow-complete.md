## Files Created This Phase

### 1. AI Actions & Integration
**File**: [src/app/actions.tsx](src/app/actions.tsx)

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Updated model from `gpt-3.5-turbo` → `gpt-4o-mini`
- ✅ Added `analyzeCareerAssessment()` function
- ✅ Builds conversation from 8 Q&A responses
- ✅ Requests final verdict and roadmap from GPT

**Key Function**:
```typescript
export async function analyzeCareerAssessment(
  roleId: string,
  systemPrompt: string,
  responses: Array<{ question: string; answer: string }>
) {
  // Builds conversation with system prompt + Q&A pairs
  // Calls GPT-4o-mini with 3000 token limit
  // Returns complete analysis text
}
```

---

### 2. Assessment Questions Library
**File**: [src/lib/assessment-questions.ts](src/lib/assessment-questions.ts)

**Purpose**: Centralized question bank for all 3 roles

**Structure**:
```typescript
export const ASSESSMENT_QUESTIONS: Record<string, AssessmentQuestion[]> = {
  "ai-prompt-engineer": [ /* 8 questions */ ],
  "ai-content-creator": [ /* 8 questions */ ],
  "ai-coach": [ /* 8 questions */ ]
}
```

**Each Question Contains**:
- `number`: 1-8
- `title`: Short category (e.g., "Background", "Skills")
- `question`: Full question text
- `placeholder`: Example answer guidance

**Total**: 24 questions (8 per role)

---

### 3. Assessment API Routes

#### Start/Get Assessment
**File**: [src/app/api/assessment/route.ts](src/app/api/assessment/route.ts)

**Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/assessment` - Start new assessment
  - Creates new or returns existing in_progress assessment
  - Links to user and role
  - Initializes empty responses array

- `GET /api/assessment?userId=X&roleId=Y` - Get user's assessment
  - Resumes incomplete assessment
  - Returns current progress

- `GET /api/assessment?id=X` - Get specific assessment
  - Returns full assessment with verdict (if completed)

**Example Request**:
```json
POST /api/assessment
{
  "userId": "demo-user-123",
  "roleId": "ai-prompt-engineer"
}
```

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "assessment": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "roleId": "ai-prompt-engineer",
    "roleName": "AI Prompt Engineer",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "currentQuestionNumber": 0,
    "responses": []
  },
  "message": "Assessment started"
}
```

---

#### Save Answer & Complete
**File**: [src/app/api/assessment/[id]/route.ts](src/app/api/assessment/[id]/route.ts)

**Endpoints**:
- `PUT /api/assessment/[id]` - Save answer to question
  - Stores Q&A in responses JSON array
  - Updates currentQuestionNumber
  - Allows resuming later

- `POST /api/assessment/[id]/complete` - Complete & analyze
  - Validates 8 questions answered
  - Calls GPT-4o-mini for analysis
  - Parses verdict tier from response
  - Stores full analysis + structured data

**Save Answer Request**:
```json
PUT /api/assessment/{assessmentId}
{
  "questionNumber": 1,
  "question": "What is your professional background?",
  "answer": "Marketing Manager, Healthcare, 5 years..."
}
```

**Complete Assessment Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "assessment": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "status": "completed",
    "verdict": {
      "tier": "NEARLY_QUALIFIED",
      "score": 65,
      "timeline": "1-3 months"
    },
    "fullAnalysis": "## QUALIFICATION VERDICT...",

## Database Schema (Reminder)

### CareerAssessmentEntity
```typescript
{
  id: uuid,
  userId: string,
  roleId: string,
  roleName: string,
  status: "in_progress" | "completed" | "abandoned",
  currentQuestionNumber: 0-8,
  responses: JSON[], // Array of Q&A objects
  verdictTier: "QUALIFIED_NOW" | "NEARLY_QUALIFIED" | ...,
  verdictScore: 0-100,
  verdictTimeline: "1-3 months",
  strengths: JSON[],
  gaps: JSON[],
  recommendations: JSON[],
  fullAnalysis: text, // Complete GPT response
  startedAt: timestamp,
  completedAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

---

## GPT-4o-mini Integration

### How It Works

1. **User Answers 8 Questions**
   - Each answer saved to database immediately
   - Stored in `responses` JSON field

2. **User Clicks "Complete Assessment"**
   - API fetches role's system prompt from database
   - Builds conversation:
     ```
     System: [Career advisor prompt with full instructions]
     User: "Ready to begin? yes"
     Assistant: "Question 1 - Background: What is..."
     User: "Marketing Manager, Healthcare, 5 years..."
     Assistant: "Question 2 - Writing: Rate your..."
     User: "8/10 - I write weekly reports..."
     ... (repeat for all 8 questions)
     User: "Please provide my qualification verdict and roadmap"
     ```

3. **GPT-4o-mini Analyzes**
   - Model: `gpt-4o-mini`
   - Temperature: 0.7 (balanced creativity)
   - Max tokens: 3000 (comprehensive response)
   - Response time: ~10-30 seconds

4. **Parse & Store Results**
   - Extract verdict tier from response text
   - Detect emojis/keywords (✅, ⚡, 📚, 🔄)
   - Calculate score (75%+ = QUALIFIED_NOW, etc.)
   - Store full analysis for display

## Next Steps (Roadmap System)

### What's Next to Build

1. **Roadmap Generation** (next phase)
   - Parse GPT roadmap section into structured tasks
   - Create RoadmapEntity + RoadmapTaskEntity records
   - Extract phases (Immediate, 3-6 Month, 6-12 Month)
   - Link to completed assessment

2. **Roadmap Display Page**
   - `/roadmap/[roadmapId]`
   - Show phases with task cards
   - Checkboxes to mark tasks complete
   - Progress tracking

3. **Dashboard**
   - `/dashboard`
   - Show all user assessments
   - Active roadmaps
   - Progress metrics
   - Streak tracking

---

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **No Real Authentication**
   - Using demo userId: `demo-user-123`
   - All users share same assessments
   - **Fix**: Add next-auth or Clerk before launch

2. **Basic Verdict Parsing**
   - Detects emojis/keywords from GPT response
   - Could miss if GPT formats differently
   - **Improvement**: Use structured output or JSON mode

3. **No Roadmap Auto-Generation**
   - GPT returns roadmap in text
   - Not yet parsed into database
   - **Next**: Parse roadmap into tasks

4. **Single Assessment per Role**
   - Users can only have one assessment per role
   - **Improvement**: Allow multiple attempts, show history

5. **No Email/Notifications**
   - Results only shown on page
   - **Improvement**: Email results, save to PDF
