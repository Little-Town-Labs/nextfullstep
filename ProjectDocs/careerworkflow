How the AI Uses These Questions
The AI combines responses with personality test results (e.g., Big 5 traits like Openness, Conscientiousness) to generate career recommendations. For example:

Closed-Ended Data: Scales (e.g., skill confidence, workplace preferences) are quantified to match users with careers requiring specific competencies or environments. For instance, high collaboration scores might suggest team-oriented roles like project management.
Open-Ended Data: Natural language processing analyzes responses to identify themes (e.g., passion for helping others might point to healthcare or non-profit roles). Keywords like “creativity” or “autonomy” are mapped to job attributes.
Personality Integration: If a user scores high on Openness and expresses interest in creative pursuits, the AI might recommend roles like graphic designer or marketing strategist, explaining how these align with their innovative nature and interests.
Fit Explanation: The AI provides a rationale for each suggestion, linking user data to job requirements (e.g., “Your leadership experience and preference for dynamic environments make you a strong fit for a startup management role”).
