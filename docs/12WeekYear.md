The 12 Week Year is a productivity and goal-setting system developed by Brian P. Moran and Michael Lennington, outlined in their book *The 12 Week Year: Get More Done in 12 Weeks than Others Do in 12 Months*. Instead of planning annually, it redefines a "year" as 12 weeks, creating urgency and focus to achieve goals faster. The core idea is to break down long-term objectives into manageable, actionable steps executed with intensity within a shorter timeframe.

### Key Concepts
1. **Periodization**: Treat each 12-week cycle as a self-contained "year." This eliminates the procrastination often associated with annual goals, as deadlines are closer.
2. **Vision**: Define a clear, compelling long-term vision (3–5 years out) and align 12-week goals to it. Your vision should include personal and professional aspirations.
3. **12-Week Goals**: Set 2–3 specific, measurable goals per cycle. Fewer goals ensure focus. For example, instead of "grow my business," aim for "increase revenue by 10% in 12 weeks."
4. **Action Plans**: Break goals into weekly tasks. Each task should be actionable and contribute directly to the goal. Plans are revisited and adjusted weekly.
5. **Weekly Scorecard**: Track progress by measuring key actions (leading indicators) rather than just outcomes. For instance, if your goal is to lose weight, track workouts completed rather than pounds lost.
6. **Time Blocking**: Schedule dedicated time for high-priority tasks, minimizing distractions. Protect this time like an appointment.
7. **Accountability**: Review progress weekly, ideally with a coach, mentor, or peer group, to stay on track and address obstacles.

### How It Works
- **Start**: Write a vision, then set 12-week goals aligned with it. For each goal, create a detailed plan with weekly actions.
- **Execute**: Focus on completing weekly tasks, not perfection. Track progress daily and score your execution (e.g., percentage of tasks completed).
- **Review**: At the end of each week, assess your scorecard (aim for 85%+ task completion). Reflect on wins and areas to improve.
- **Reset**: After 12 weeks, evaluate outcomes, celebrate successes, and start a new cycle with refined goals.

### Benefits
- Creates urgency, reducing procrastination.
- Simplifies planning by focusing on short-term execution.
- Encourages consistent progress through frequent feedback.
- Aligns daily actions with long-term aspirations.

### Criticisms
- Can feel intense or unsustainable for some, especially without breaks between cycles.
- Requires discipline to stick to weekly tracking and reviews.
- May not suit goals needing longer timelines (e.g., complex projects).

### Example
**Vision**: Become a published author in 3 years.
**12-Week Goal**: Write 20,000 words of a manuscript.
**Weekly Plan**: Write 1,700 words (3 sessions of 600 words), review 1 chapter, and read 1 writing craft article.
**Scorecard**: Track sessions completed (e.g., 3/3 writing sessions = 100%).
**Review**: Adjust word count target if needed based on weekly progress.

### Getting Started
1. Read *The 12 Week Year* for detailed guidance or check summaries online.
2. Define your vision and pick 1–3 goals for the next 12 weeks.
3. Use tools like the 12 Week Year templates (available on their website), a planner, or apps like Trello for tracking.
4. Commit to weekly reviews, ideally with an accountability partner.
