# Comprehensive Project Plan for Professional Development Platform

This project plan builds upon the existing AI interaction feature implementation plan and the provided project documentation. It outlines a detailed roadmap for completing the Professional Development Platform, aligning with the tech stack (Next.js 14/15 with App Router, TypeScript, SQLite with TypeORM, Zustand, Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui, and OpenAI GPT models) and project goals (maintainability, security, performance, and user experience). The plan includes tasks, subtasks, timelines, and completion criteria to ensure clarity and progress tracking.
