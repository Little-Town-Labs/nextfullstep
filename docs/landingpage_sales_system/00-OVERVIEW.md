# Landing Page Sales System - Overview

## Purpose
Transform the NextFullStep landing page from a simple redirect into a high-converting lead generation machine using a proven assessment-based sales system.

## Current State
- Landing page (`/`) immediately redirects to `/careers`
- Missing critical opportunity to capture and qualify leads
- No lead capture before assessment
- No tiered next steps based on qualification level

## Target State
- Compelling landing page with 20-40% conversion to quiz
- 15-question assessment that captures contact info + qualification data
- Dynamic results page with personalized next steps
- Lead management dashboard for sales follow-up
- Email automation nurture sequence

## Key Benefits
1. **Capture leads BEFORE showing product** - Build email list for remarketing
2. **Qualify prospects automatically** - AI scores readiness, identifies budget signals
3. **Personalized conversion paths** - High-value leads get 1-on-1 calls, low-value get content
4. **Actionable lead data** - Know exactly where each prospect stands and what they need
5. **Scalable sales process** - System works 24/7 without human intervention

## Success Metrics (90-Day Targets)
- **25%+** of visitors start the quiz
- **70%+** complete all 15 questions
- **100+** qualified leads per month (traffic-dependent)
- **20%+** click recommended next step CTA
- **5-10%** of hot leads convert to paid customers
