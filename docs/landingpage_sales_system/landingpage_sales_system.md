Summary
The core message of this source is that lead generation is the most critical factor for business success, and it proposes a multi-million dollar strategy centered around an automated online assessment or quiz to achieve this. The system begins with a specifically designed landing page featuring a compelling hook—either addressing a frustration or presenting a desirable readiness sentence—followed by a clear value proposition and credibility builders. Users then proceed to a 15-question quiz, which first captures essential contact information and then asks ten best practices questions to determine a score, alongside five qualifying questions to gauge their current situation, desired outcomes, perceived obstacles, and preferred solutions, thereby revealing their potential budget. Finally, the system delivers dynamic results and highly customized next steps (such as a one-on-one meeting, group content, or a book recommendation) based on the specific answers provided, ensuring the generation of high-quality, pre-qualified leads.

Lead Generation

if there is one thing that I've learned over the last 20 years of scaling multiple companies it's this Everything is downstream from lead generation If you can generate leads you can solve all the other problems after that But if you cannot generate leads you are dead in the water And today I want to share with you my multi-million dollar lead generation system that has worked on agencies software companies education and training coaching consulting and a range of other businesses that I've been involved with Every single time I take on board a new business project I start by setting up one of these online assessments that just generates leads And off the back of the consistent results that these get we can scale up from there And it's going to totally transform the number and the quality of clients that come through your business's front door So let's get started on how to set up an online assessment that creates leads like nobody's business Step one for creating an online assessment is to create a landing page that really explains to people what the online assessment is going to do for them Why would they take an online assessment the first part of the landing page is the top of the landing page This is the first thing people see when they're scrolling through their phone Now they arrive at this landing page and it has either one of two hooks Hook number one is called a frustration hook A frustration hook names the frustration that people are experiencing So it could be feeling frustrated that you're not getting the fitness results that you want even though you work out every week Feeling frustrated that you're not getting investment returns even though you invest consistently every month Feeling frustrated that you have not been able to scale up your marketing even though you're willing to invest in ads Right so anything that is the frustration feeling frustrated that blank happens even though you're doing this very powerful frustration hook The second one is a results hook And the way I like to do a results hook is a readiness sentence Are you ready to run your first marathon are you ready to have the relationship of your dreams are you ready to protect your business from a cyber security threat right so anything that you can help people get as a result if you ask people are they ready for that result they're going to say "Oh I'm not sure if I'm ready I want to take this assessment to find out." Now the subheading of the hook says "Answer 15 questions to find out why you're experiencing this frustration and what to do about it." So the subheading directs people to take the assessment answer 15 questions so they can find out if they're ready or if they can deal with this frustration So the next part of the landing page is called the value proposition The way to do a value proposition is to tell people to take this assessment so that we can measure and improve three key areas So let's say you're doing a sleep assessment Are you ready to get 7 hours or more of really high quality deep sleep you would then have the value proposition Answer these 15 questions so that we can measure and improve your sleep environment your sleep routine and your sleep nutrition or whatever it is So you're going to give people a value proposition You're going to say "We're going to measure and improve three key things and you're going to list those three things and those are going to be three things that people would love to achieve along the way to a better result." So that's the value proposition When people hear a powerful hook and a good value proposition they immediately want to know whether it's credible It sounds almost too good to be true So they want to know who are you what's your background what research have you done so under the credibility section we need to say who created this which is you and your bio What have you done in the past so what's your background and the research that you've done so you might be able to quote some statistics some figures You might be able to say 85% of people struggle with X Y and Zed You might be able to say a recent Harvard University study found that 15% of people are achieving X Y and Zed This number could be dramatically improved right so who are you what have you done in the past what research have you done in order to create this assessment then the final thing is called a call to action a CTA And a call to action what we want to do here is a really powerful call to action And we want to cover a few key things here We want to say start the quiz cuz that's the next step It only takes 3 minutes to complete It's completely free and you get immediate recommendations on how you can improve That combination is very powerful as a call to action Now if you get this right you will have 20 to 40% of people who hit that landing page going ahead and starting the quiz And that is going to be a massive lead generator for you So part two of this online assessment lead generation strategy is the quiz questions This is where we're going to find out a lot of information about every single person who's signaling interest for you Now this questionnaire is actually going to have three parts to it Part one is where you're going to ask them their name their email address automatically We're going to get their location because of their IP address And you're going to give them the opportunity to enter their phone number but you're not going to make it mandatory to do that So the two things they have to enter in order to start the quiz is their name and their email address The location will be picked up by the system and the phone number will be optional So the contact information is the first things that we want to capture Then we want to go into the first 10 questions Now these 10 questions we're going to call these the best practices questions So the best practices questions is we're going to ask people if they're doing 10 things that they should be doing So if this scorecard was about uh sleep we might ask them if they get to bed on time at the same time if they're using too many screens before bed If this assessment was about health and fitness and losing weight do they track their calories do they work out three or four times a week whatever you consider to be the best practices you're going to ask them 10 questions that allude to how many of these best practices they've been able to say yes to or no to And that's what's going to give them their score which we'll get to soon So you've got to come up with 10 best practices that you think people should be doing if they're doing all the right things and that's going to inform the score But now we're going to add five more questions that are going to be really powerful questions for you to be able to make more sales So here's the big five questions that I want you to ask that allow you to qualify your leads and make more sales Question number one is which best describes your current situation So you might give people uh four or five options to choose from I'm a student Uh I'm in my first 5 years of my career Uh I'm a manager I'm a senior leader I'm an executive Or uh I've never run a marathon before Uh I've run one to three marathons I'm a seasoned marathon runner Whatever is their current situation you want to know how they describe it The next question is which describes your desired outcome that you would like to achieve in the next 90 days And then you give them a list of things that they want to achieve in the next 90 days And ask them which is the most important desired outcome for you to achieve in the next 90 days That gives them the opportunity to tell you what is the number one thing that's driving their decisions They might say "I want to lose weight or I want to achieve my first 7 hours worth of deep sleep." Right whatever it is they're going to say that's the outcome that I want in the next 90 days Question number three is what is the obstacle that you think is stopping you or what have you tried that hasn't worked in the past and you'll give them a list of three or four things to choose from so they can select what they think is the biggest obstacle to their success The fourth question is which solution do you think would suit you best and you could say I want uh education and training I want one-to-one coaching Uh I want software Uh I want someone to do it all for me Right so you can give them some potential solutions Now the benefit of this question is that it implies what they're willing to spend Someone who only wants a book is probably going to spend $10 or $20 Someone who says "I want it all done for me," they're probably thinking $10,000 to $20,000 So the solution that people have in mind will tell you a little bit about their budget that they have in mind And the fifth question is "Is there anything else that you think we need to know about?" Now this is an openbox question and it allows them to type anything into the box that they want And the craziest thing is that a lot of times people will tell you what's driving their decision or they'll tell you useful information that helps you to make a sale I've had people put into that box uh I've already read your book and I want to get started or I have a budget but I have to spend it by the end of the month Right incredible stuff that people will put into that box that is incredibly helpful If they've answered all of those 14 other questions they're going to give you some really good relevant information if they fill in that question as well So those are the 15 questions that we want people to answer And when they do that we can give them what we call their dynamic results So the reason we call it dynamic results is because this entire results page can completely change depending on how they answered the questions So for example we could have a little speedometer here that tells people how they performed You got a 75% out of 100% We could have a thermometer that tells people that they're cold warm or hot Right so we could put anything we want here as a result And we can tell people "Congratulations you scored really well." We could say "Oh no You've got a lot of room to improve." We could say "Well done You've got strong foundations but plenty of room to improve." We can change the content that goes here depending on how people answered the questions So here's what we want to have Number one we want to have the big reveal So the big reveal is the overall result This is how you did in general Then we want to have three insights So as a result of how you answered the question what are three things that I want you to know then finally we want to have some next steps Uh and those next steps would be completely different depending upon how people answered the questions If someone's answered the questions in a way that's highly qualified you might want to offer them a one-to-one meeting If someone is somewhere in the middle you might want to offer them a group presentation a group event Maybe if someone has answered the question so that you know that they are absolutely wrong for your business you may just want to give them some content So you might send them to a video episode or a podcast episode or you might recommend a book But this can change depending on how people answer the questions And then finally down the bottom you want to have all your contact information maybe your social media links and all of that sort of stuff so that if people want to bounce around off that page they can leave that open but they can also open up other pages So you definitely want to have your website there as well So this basically is a end to-end system where they discover that there is an assessment They then answer 15 questions and then they get their dynamic results with specialized next steps based on how they answered those questions This is incredibly powerful because you can see the quality of the leads that come in When this captures all of the leads you actually get to see how people answered all the questions You can see how they scored You can see where they are You can see whether they've put real contact information in You can see the recommended next step It's all laid out in the dashboard for you It's incredible Now this entire system might seem like it's an incredibly difficult and complex system to set up but it's all completely automated for you at scoreapp.com I'm the co-founder of that software company and I've put all of my best thinking into one place We've got 150 templates that are based on this strategy We've got a downloadable book called Scorecard Marketing We've got online courses that explain exactly how to do it And we've got an amazing customer success team that will just get on a call with you and help you to set this up It could not possibly be easier In fact most people get set up in about 10 20 30 minutes and then they're ready to go Either way the juice is worth the squeeze because this thing produces so many high-quality leads So there'll be a link in the description below so you can get set up on scoreapp.com as well So the one question that everyone asks me once they see this system is "How do I send people to this landing page how do I get more clicks how do I get more conversions how do I send paid traffic how do I send organic traffic to this landing page?" So let me tell you I've just created a video before this one that answers that exact question I'm going to link to that video in the description below and that video talks exactly step by step how to start small and then scale big for getting attention into landing page traffic So you're going to see the link to that video in the description below As I said at the beginning everything is downstream from lead generation If you can master lead generation everything else comes off the back of that You'll be able to get more sales You'll be able to hire the right people You'll be able to scale your business if you can get this lead generation sorted once and for all I hope you've enjoyed this video and I hope your business is successful
